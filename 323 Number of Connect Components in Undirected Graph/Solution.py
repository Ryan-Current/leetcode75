# Description
# In this problem, there is an undirected graph with n nodes. There is also an edges array. Where edges[i] = [a, b] means that there is an edge between node a and node b in the graph.

# You need to return the number of connected components in that graph.

# Example
# Example 1

# Input:

# 3
# [[0,1], [0,2]]
# Output:

# 1
# Example 2

# Input:

# 6
# [[0,1], [1,2], [2, 3], [4, 5]]
# Output:

# 2

# Leetcode description:
# You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicatesthat there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph (undirected).

# Returnthe numberof connected components in the graph


# Input: n= 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
# Output: 2

# Because there are 2 separate sections of the graph
# 0 <---> 1 <---> 2
# 3 <---> 4
